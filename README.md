# multiplepayloadstesting

This Python script is designed to evaluate a set of predefined payloads against a designated web application. It transmits POST requests to the target URL and records the response status and content for each payload. This tool can be advantageous for assessing web application firewalls (WAF) or other security mechanisms.
